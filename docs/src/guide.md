## Loading a model

The simplest way to use HiGHS to solve a model is to load it from a
file using the method
[__readModel__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Load-a-model). Different
file formats are recognised from the filename extension. HiGHS can
read plain text MPS files and (CPLEX) LP files. In general, HiGHS can
read compressed files.

Alternatively, data generated by an application can be passed to HiGHS
via an instance of the __HighsLp__ class populated by the user and
passed using the method
[__passModel__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Pass-a-model). In
languages where such structures cannot be used, data constituting an
LP model can be passed via individual parameters.

### Building a model

The model in HiGHS can be built using a sequence of calls to add
variables and constraints. This is most easily done one-by-one using
the methods [__addCol__ and
__addRow__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Build-a-model). Alterntively,
[__addVar__ and
__addRow__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Build-a-model)
can be used, with
[__changeColCost__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Build-a-model)
used to define each objective coefficient.

Addition of multiple variables and constraints can be achieved using
[__addVars__ and
__addRows__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Build-a-model),
with
[__changeColsCost__](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Build-a-model)
used to define objective coefficients. Note that defining the model in
this way requires vectors of data and the specification of constraint
coefficients as compressed
[row-wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_(CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format))
or
[column-wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_column_(CSC_or_CCS))
matrices.

### Solving a model

The incumbent model in HiGHS is solved by a call to the method
[run](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Solve-a-model). By
default, HiGHS minimizes the model's objective function. Where possible, HiGHS will [hot
start](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/guide/#Hot-start) the
solver using solution information obtained on previous runs, or
supplied by the user.

### Model and solution management

HiGHS has comprehensive tools for defining and extracting models. This
can be done either to/from MPS or (CPLEX) format LP files, or via
method calls. HiGHS also has methods that permit the incumbent model
to be modified. Solutions can be supplied and extracted using either
files or method calls.

### Extracting the results

After solving a model, its status is the value returnedby the method
[getModelStatus](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Extract-results). This
value is of type
[HighsModelStatus](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/enums/#HighsModelStatus). Scalar
information about a solved model is obtained using the method
[getInfo](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Extract-results). The
solution and (any) basis are returned by the methods
[getSolution](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Extract-results)
and
[getBasis](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Extract-results)
respectively. HiGHS can also be used to write the solution to a file
using the method
[writeSolution](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Report-results).

## Option values

The option values that control HiGHS are of type __string__, __bool__,
__int__ and __double__. Options are referred to by a __string__
identical to the name of their identifier. A full specification of the
options is given
[here](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/HighsOptions/). An option
value is changed by passing its name and value to the method
[setOptionValue](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Option-values). The
current value of an option is obtained by passing its name to the
method
[getOptionValue](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Option-values)

## Extracting model data

The numbers of column, rows and nonzeros in the model are returned by
the methods
[getNumCols](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data),
[getNumRows](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data)
and
[getNumEntries](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data)
respectively.

Model data can be extracted for a single column or row by specifying the
index of the column or row and calling the methods
[getCol](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data)
and
[getRow](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data). As
well as returning the value of the cost and bounds, these methods also
return the number of nonzeros in the corresponding column or row of
the constraint matrix. The indices and values of the nonzeros can be
obtained using the methods
[getColEntries](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data)
and
[getRowEntries](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data).

For multiple columns and rows defined by a set of indices, the corresponding data can be extracted using the methods
[getCols](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data),
[getRows](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data),
[getColsEntries](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data) and
[getRowsEntries](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data).

Specific matrix coefficients obtained using the method
[getCoeff](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Get-model-data).

## Modifying model data

The most immediate model modification is to change the sense of the
objective. By default, HiGHS minimizes the model's objective
function. The objective sense can be set to minimize (maximize) using
[changeObjectiveSense](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data).

Model data for can be changed for one column or row by specifying the
index of the column or row, together with the new scalar value for the
cost or bounds, the specific methods being
[changeColCost](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data),
[changeColBounds](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data). The
corresponding method for a row is
[changeRowBounds](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data). Changes
for multiple columns or rows are defined by supplying a list of
indices, together with arrays of new values, using the methods
[changeColsCost](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data),
[changeColsBounds](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data). The
corresponding method for a row is
[changeRowsBounds](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data). An
individual matrix coefficient is changed by passing its row index,
column index and new value to
[changeCoeff](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Modify-model-data).

## Other operations

To run HiGHS from a user-defined solution or basis, this is passed to HiGHS using the methods [setSolution](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Set-solution) or [setBasis](http://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/python/example-py/#Set-basis).
