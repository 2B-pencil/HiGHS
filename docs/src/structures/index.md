# [Introduction](@id structures-intro)

There are several specialist data structures that can be used to
interact with HiGHS when using [`C++`](@ref cpp-getting-started) and
[`Python`](@ref python-getting-started), and they are defined in the sections on [enums](@ref Enums)
and [classes](@ref classes-overview). However, the
use of classes is not necessary for the basic use of `highspy`. As
with the `C` and `Fortran` interfaces, there are equivalent methods
that use simple scalars and vectors of data.
